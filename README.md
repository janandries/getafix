After downloading and extracting the .zip (or cloning the repo)

# 1. Install dependencies using pip
- Open the folder containing the main.py file.
- Type `cmd` in the address bar and press enter. THis will open a command window with the current path set to the folder you called `cmd` from.
- Enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies for this project (for more advanced users it is recommended to create a virtual environment)

# 2. Run main.py
- It is best to run main.py from a window so that when a error appears, you will see what error it is.
- From the same cmd window as previous step, type: `python main.py` and press enter
- Then select the original Cura-generate gcode file and follow instructions.
